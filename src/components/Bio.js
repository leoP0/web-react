							In my free time I enjoy playing and watching soccer. I'm a huge fan of the 
							sport and enjoy going to the stadium and scream my head off. The league I 
							enjoy watching the most is the Champions League. In the past I have also 
							coached soccer ranging in ages of 9yr old â€“ High School Varsity teams. 
							Soccer is not only sport I like to watch or practice; I also enjoy hiking, 
							watching boxing and baseball.

							As an engineer, I enjoy working on technical tasks, learning, and 
							accomplishing challenging tasks. My goal is to contribute as much as possible
							either independently or as a team member. Some of the skills sets I have are: 
							troubleshooting, embedded programing, comprehension of IC analog design and 
							layout, circuit design and DC-DC conversion efficiency.
